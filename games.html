<h2>This is my opinion about playstation and Xbox.</h2>
<h1>Xbox</h1>
<h2>This is the consoles I play on and have lots of fun playing it.</h2>
<h3>Also, I don't hate Playstation I like all consoles equal. I am a Xbox person but there are bad things about it that I'll talk about it later.</h3>
<h2>The goods things about Xbox are there is a lot of games that you can play but mostly first person shooters games and some games be on sale and you can play old xbox games on newer xboxs.</h2>
<h2>The bads things about Xbox is the unnecessary power brick and pay 15 dollars to play online and get over 100 games a month but you just can pay for 10 dollars.</h2>
<h1>Playstation</h1>
<h2>Now for Playstation i like Playstation but i am a xbox person </h2>
<h2>But the good things about Playstation is there is a lot of games that you that have not to play online.</h2>
<h3>The bad things about Playstation is there alway people that yell at you ot say they will hack you or even boot you offline.</h3>
